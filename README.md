# StockMarketPricePrediction
Project Scope:
Build a Stock market price prediction Model using Linear Regression that aims to determine the future movement of the stock value of a financial exchange. This Includes Finding the right combination of features to make the Prediction profitable.

Requirements:

• Software: We use Jupyter Notebook in this Project due to its Smooth-running server-client application. The Jupyter Notebook App can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access or can be installed on a remote server and accessed through the internet.

• Dataset: The Dataset here is acquired from the Stock Value of TSLA.inc from finance.yahoo.com. (1)

• Personal Computer: A Personal Computer can be defined as an end point of connection which will connect with the computer network.

Problem Definition:
Prediction of Stock Price Index Movement is regarded as a challenging task of financial time series prediction. An accurate prediction of stock price movement may yield profits for investors. Due to the complexity of stock market data, development of efficient models for predicting is very Difficult.
Predicting stock prices is an enigmatic task pursued by many. Spot-on accuracy may not be practical but sometimes even simple linear models can be surprisingly close. In this Project we will create a Stock Market Price Prediction Model using Linear Regression that will help the user to Predict the Prices of certain Stocks over a period of time.

Research Objective:
Build a Stock market prediction Model that aims to determine the future movement of the stock value of a financial exchange. The accurate prediction of share price movement will lead to more profit investors can make. The Model is used to Determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange.
The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit. In this Project, we will train a regression model using historic pricing data and technical indicators to make predictions on future prices.

Libraries and Modules Used:

• Pandas: Pandas is an open-source library in Python. It provides ready to use high- performance data structures and data analysis tools. Pandas module runs on top of NumPy and it is popularly used for data science and data analytics

• Pandas.ta: It is a Technical Analysis library to financial time series datasets. You can use to do feature engineering. It is built on Python Pandas library. An easy-to-use Python 3 Pandas Extension with 130+ Technical Analysis Indicators. Can be called from a Pandas DataFrame or standalone like TA-Lib.

• Sci-kit learn: Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, etc.
